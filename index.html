                    <p>I struggled a bit during first year of college because I wasn't sure what my career aspirations were and it was a new environment for me. But once I enter my final year of college and choose my specialization, I was able to bring up my grade by a considerable amount. So as the classes got tougher, my grades got better. <br><br> My grades are not really a good indication of what all I have achieved in college. Even though my grades may be low, I participated in a lot of projects and internships. 
                    (Then show your strength) <br><br> My efforts have been focused on building real world skills, rather than scoring A grades in all my exams.</p>
                    <p>My grades are not an indication of what I achieved academically in college. Although I didn't get the best overall grades, I was among the top 5 in xyz course. I implemented those learnings on 2 things: <br>
                        1. Working on 2 high impact project involving the implementation of xyz. In fact, it was awarded the best project award in my batch of 90 students. <br>
                        2. I also did an internship in analytics team of xyz where I conducted a successful poc on how to migrate a xyz.</p>
                    <p>During college, I struggled to maintain a balance between my academic responsibilities. My personal life as well as part time work which led to low grades. I have learned from my mistakes and I have even developed better time management skills and taken guidance from my professors to improve myself. My efforts have been focused on building real world skills rather than scoring A grade in all my exams and that's the experience that I wish to bring to this organisation. <br>                       (Convince the interviewer that whatever the reason was for poor grades, it will not impact your professional work or career)
